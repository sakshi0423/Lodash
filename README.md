# Lodash

In this project, you will be implementing some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular [lodash.js](https://lodash.com/) library. You will be implementing ten methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

In implementing each method, we will follow these four steps:
  - Specify the functionality of the method we are implementing
  - Ideate a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code
  - Implement our game plan
  - Test our code to ensure it works as expected
